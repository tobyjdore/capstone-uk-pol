       "<p class=\"speech-speaker\">Theresa May (Conservative)</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"speech-location\">Location: Birmingham</p>\n",
       "<!-- <p class=\"speech-priority\">Priority: </p> -->\n",
       "<div class=\"speech-content\"><p>Thank you very much for that warm welcome. Youâll have to excuse me if I cough during this speech; Iâve been up all night supergluing the backdrop. There are some things about last yearâs conference I have tried to forget. But I will always remember the warmth I felt from everyone in the hall. You supported me all the way â thank you.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>This year marks a century since the end of the First World War. Just a few hundred yards from this conference centre stands a Hall of Memory, built to honour the sacrifice of men and women from this city in that terrible conflict. Inscribed within it are some familiar words: âAT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN, AND IN THE MORNING, WE WILL REMEMBER THEM.â</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We do remember them. We remember the young men who left their homes to fight and die in the mud and horror of the trenches. We remember the sailors who shovelled coal into hellfire furnaces in the bowels of battleships. We remember the selflessness of a remarkable generation, whose legacy is the freedom we enjoy today.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>I think of Hubert Grant â my fatherâs cousin in whose honour he was named. Hubert fought and died at Passchendaele at the age of just 19. Last year, at the service to mark the centenary of that battle, I took a moment to find his name on the Menin Gate, alongside thousands of his comrades. We will remember them.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But the builders of that Hall of Memory also wanted us to do something else. Alongside a commitment to remember, they inscribed a command that still calls to us today:</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>âSEE TO IT THAT THEY SHALL NOT HAVE SUFFERED AND DIED IN VAIN.â</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Those words express a determination that transformed our country. A determination that the men who returned from the quagmires of Passchendaele to their families, here in Birmingham and across the land, should have homes fit for heroes. That the women who made munitions, kept the buses and trains running, served as firefighters and police officers, should have a voice in our democracy. That a country which stood together in solidarity, with people of every class sharing the danger, should become a fairer place.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A generation later, another victory built on shared sacrifice renewed that determination. Twice in a century, Britain came together to beat the odds and build a better future. A stronger democracy in the Mother of Parliaments â where every person, no matter their gender, no matter their class, has an equal voice. A fairer economy in the home of the free market â where enterprise creates wealth to fund great public services. A more secure future in the post-war world â where former enemies become friends and the trans-Atlantic alliance makes our world a safer place. We must recapture that spirit of common purpose.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Because the lesson of that remarkable generation is clear: if we come together, there is no limit to what we can achieve. Our future is in our hands. And that is why we are all in this hall today. It is the reason we chose to get involved in politics in the first place. We believe that by standing up to be counted, by working together, we can change our communities and our country for the better. Itâs not always glamorous. Iâve seen the trailers for âBodyguardâ and let me tell you â it wasnât like that in my day. Real politics involves a lot of hard graft. Knocking on doors in all weathers.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Delivering bundles of leaflets. We do it because we believe in its potential to transform lives. We understood when we got involved that sometimes itâs adversarial. But in the last few years somethingâs changed for the worse. I feel it. I am sure you do too. Rigorous debate between political opponents is becoming more like a confrontation between enemies. People who put themselves forward to serve are becoming targets. Not just them, their families as well. We all saw the sickening pictures of a far-left extremist shouting abuse at Jacob Rees-Moggâs children. And itâs not only Conservatives who are facing abuse.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The first black woman ever to be elected to the House of Commons receives more racist and misogynist messages today than when she first stood over 30 years ago. You do not have to agree with a word Diane Abbott says to believe passionately in her right to say it, free from threats and abuse. Some people have lost sight of the fact that political differences are not everything. I have served in local and national government, in office and in opposition. I know that no party has a monopoly on good ideas. That getting things done requires working together â within parties and beyond them.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>When our politics becomes polarised, and compromise becomes a dirty word, that becomes harder. And good people are put off public service. It doesnât have to be this way.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Our Party has more elected representatives than any other. We have in our hands the power to set a standard of decency that will be an example for others to follow. John McCain, who spoke at this conference 12 years ago, put it like this:</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>âWe argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement.â</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>That was Jo Coxâs message too.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It is a truth that the British people instinctively understand. Because they are not ideologues. They know we all have a common stake in this country and that the only path to a better future is one that we walk down together.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>So, letâs rise above the abuse. Letâs make a positive case for our values that will cut through the bitterness and bile that is poisoning our politics. Letâs say it loud and clear: Conservatives will always stand up for a politics that unites us rather than divides us.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>That used to be Labourâs position too. But when I look at its leadership today, I worry itâs no longer the case. We all remember what the Labour Party used to be. We passionately disagreed with many of their policies. Every Labour Government left unemployment higher than they found it. Every Labour Government ran out of other peopleâs money to spend.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Every Labour Government left the economy in a mess. But at least they had some basic qualities that everyone could respect. They were proud of our institutions. They were proud of our armed forces. They were proud of Britain. Today, when I look across at the opposition benches, I can still see that Labour Party. The heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Dennis Healy and John Smith. But not on the front bench.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Instead their faces stare blankly out from the rows behind, while another party occupies prime position: the Jeremy Corbyn Party.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The Jeremy Corbyn Party rejects the common values that once bridged our political divide.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Compare Jeremy Corbynâs behaviour to that of his predecessors.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Would Neil Kinnock, who stood-up to the hard-left, have stood by while his own MPs faced deselection, and needed police protection at their Party conference?</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Would Jim Callaghan, who served in the Royal Navy, have asked the Russian government to confirm the findings of our own intelligence agencies?</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Would Clement Attlee, Churchillâs trusted deputy during the Second World War, have told British Jews they didnât know the meaning of antisemitism?</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>What has befallen Labour is a national tragedy.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>What has it come to when Jewish families today seriously discuss where they should go if Jeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister?</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>When a leading Labour MP says his party is âinstitutionally racistâ?</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>When the Leader of the Labour Party is happy to appear on Iranian state TV, but attacks our free media here in Britain?</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>That is what Jeremy Corbyn has done to the Labour Party.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It is our duty, in this Conservative Party, to make sure he can never do it to our country.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>To do that we need to be a Party for the whole country.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Because today millions of people, who have never supported our Party in the past, are appalled by what Jeremy Corbyn has done to Labour.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>They want to support a party that is decent, moderate, and patriotic.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>One that puts the national interest first.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Delivers on the issues they care about.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And is comfortable with modern Britain in all its diversity.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We must show everyone in this country that we are that Party.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A Party that conserves the best of our inheritance, but is not afraid of change.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A party of patriotism, but not nationalism.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A party that believes in business, but is not afraid to hold businesses to account.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A party that believes in the good that government can do, but knows government will never have all the answers.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A party that believes your success in life should not be defined by who you love, your faith, the colour of your skin, who your parents were, or where you were raised â but by your talent and your hard work.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Above all a party of Unionism, not just of four proud nations, but of all our people.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A party not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And we must be a party that is not in thrall to ideology, but motivated instead by enduring principles.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>For me they can be summed-up in three words: Security. Freedom. Opportunity.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Security for the nation with strong defences against threats from abroad, and protection against threats at home.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Security for communities, upheld by the brave men and women of our police forces.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Security for individuals and families, provided by a good job, a home of your own, and dignity in old age.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And security is the bedrock of freedom.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of action.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The freedom to make decisions for yourself, rather than have them made for you by government.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The freedom that our grandparents and great grandparents fought for against tyranny.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The freedom that swept across Eastern Europe when the Soviet Union collapsed, and nations were reborn in sovereignty and independence.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The freedom that is still denied to many in our world today.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But with freedom should always come responsibility.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>To obey the law, even when you disagree with it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>To conserve our environment, for the next generation.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And most especially for those in public life â the responsibility to weigh the impact our words and actions have on other people.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And if we are secure and we are free, then opportunity is opened-up.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The opportunity to take your future in your hands. To dream, and strive, and achieve a better life.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>To know that if your dad arrived on a plane from Pakistan, you can become Home Secretary.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>That if you spent time in care, you can be in the Cabinet.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>That if your grandparents came to our shores as part of the Windrush generation you could be the next Mayor of London.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>That if you are pregnant with your first child and engaged to your girlfriend, you could be the next First Minister of Scotland.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We, the Conservative Party, are the party of opportunity.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>No institution embodies our principles as Conservatives more profoundly or more personally than our National Health Service.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It gives every man, woman and child the absolute security of knowing that whenever you are sick, care will be there.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>What greater freedom than to live your life never having to worry about whether you can afford the treatment you need?</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>What greater opportunity for a country to make the most of all its talents?</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The NHS is a service that is there for everyone; free at the point of use; with care based always on clinical need, never the ability to pay.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>These principles are in our countryâs DNA.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And Conservatives will always uphold them.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Indeed, Conservatives have looked after our NHS for most of its life.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And this year we gave the NHS a seventieth birthday present to be proud of: the biggest cash boost in its history.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>An extra Â£394 million every single week.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And in return, the NHS will produce a new long-term plan to make sure every penny makes a difference on the front line.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>So, next time you hear someone say that the Tories donât care about the NHS, tell them about that extra funding.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Tell them about the Conservative MPs who work in the NHS in their spare time.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Tell them about the Tory Prime Minister who can only do her job thanks to the wonderful staff of her local NHS trust, who help her manage diabetes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Tell them about our Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Last year James officially opened the new Guyâs Cancer Centre at Queen Maryâs Hospital in his constituency.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A few months later he was a patient.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The outstanding NHS care he received helped him recover, and now he is back serving in the Cabinet.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Cancer can strike any of us at any time.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A few years ago, my goddaughter was diagnosed with cancer.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>She underwent treatment and it seemed to be working.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But then the cancer came back.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Last summer, she sent me a text to tell me that she was hoping to see another Christmas.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But she didnât make it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Half of us will be diagnosed with cancer. All of us know someone who has been.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Survival rates are increasing, but we are lagging behind other countries.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>So today I can announce a new Cancer Strategy, funded through our 70th birthday investment, will form a central part of our long-term plan for the NHS.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The key to boosting your chance of surviving cancer is early diagnosis.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Five-year survival rates for bowel cancer are over 90% if caught early, but less than 10% if diagnosed late.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Through our Cancer Strategy, we will increase the early detection rate from one-in-two today, to-three-in four by 2028.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We will do it by lowering the age at which we screen for bowel cancer from 60 to 50.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>By investing in the very latest scanners.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And by building more Rapid Diagnostic Centres â one stop-shops that help people get treatment quicker.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>This will be a step-change in how we diagnose cancer.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It will mean that by 2028, 55,000 more people will be alive five years after their diagnosis compared to today.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Every life saved means precious extra years with friends and family.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Every life saved means a parent, a partner, a child, a god mother spared the pain of losing a loved one before their time.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Our NHS saves countless lives every day.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>That is never more true than when our national security is threatened.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Those are the times when I feel most keenly the responsibilities of my office.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>They are our close friends and allies, and we should ensure it stays that way.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Thatâs what I said at Lancaster House.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Itâs what we promised in our manifesto.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>Britain isnât afraid to leave with no deal if we have to.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But we need to be honest about it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Leaving without a deal â introducing tariffs and costly checks at the border â would be a bad outcome for the UK and the EU.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It would be tough at first, but the resilience and ingenuity of the British people would see us through.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Some people ask me to rule out no deal.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But if I did that I would weaken our negotiating position and have to agree to whatever the EU offers.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And at the moment that would mean accepting one of two things.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Either a deal that keeps us in the EU in all but name, keeps free movement, keeps vast annual payments and stops us signing trade deals with other countries.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Or a deal that carves off Northern Ireland, a part of this country, effectively leaving it in the EUâs Customâs Union.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>So, let us send a clear message from this hall today: we will never accept either of those choices.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We will not betray the result of the referendum.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And we will never break up our country.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>In a negotiation, if you canât accept what the other side proposes, you present an alternative.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>That is what we have done.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Our proposal is for a free trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It would protect hundreds of thousands of jobs in the just-in-time supply chains our manufacturing firms rely on.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Businesses wouldnât face costly checks when they export to the EU, so they can invest with confidence.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And it would protect our precious Union â the seamless border in Northern Ireland, a bedrock of peace and stability, would see no change whatsoever.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>No simple free trade agreement could achieve that, not even one that makes use of the very latest technology.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Our proposal would be good for our rural communities, getting us out of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It would be good for our coastal communities.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We would be out of the Common Fisheries Policy, an independent coastal state once again.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And with the UKâs biggest fishing fleets based in Scotland, let me say this to Nicola Sturgeon.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>You claim to stand up for Scotland, but you want to lock Scottish fishermen into the CFP forever.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Thatâs not âStronger for Scotlandâ, itâs a betrayal of Scotland.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Our proposal would mean we could renew our role in the world, strike new trade deals with other countries.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>With control of our money, we can spend more on our NHS.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>With control of our laws, we can bring decision-making closer to the people and returning powers to Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And with control of our borders, we can do something that no British government has been able to do in decades â restore full and complete control of who comes into this country to the democratically elected representatives of the British people.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And this is what we will do with the immigration powers we take back.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The free movement of people will end, once and for all.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>In its place we will introduce a new system.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It will be based on what skills you have to offer, not which country you come from.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Throughout our history, migrants have made a huge contribution to our country â and they will continue to in the future.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Those with the skills we need, who want to come here and work hard, will find a welcome.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But we will be able to reduce the numbers, as we promised.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And by ending free movement we will give British business an incentive to train our own young people and to invest in technology that will improve their productivity.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>So this is our proposal. Taking back control of our borders, laws and money.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Good for jobs, good for the Union.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It delivers on the referendum.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It keeps faith with the British people.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>It is in the national interest.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Even if we do not all agree on every part of this proposal, we need to come together.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Because itâs time we faced up to what is at risk.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We have a Labour Party that, if they were in Government, would accept any deal the EU chose to offer, regardless of how bad it is for the UK.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But who also say theyâll oppose any deal I choose to bring back, regardless of how good it is for the UK.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>They are not acting in the national interest, but their own political interest.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And there are plenty of prominent people in British politics â in Parliament and out of it â who want to stop Brexit in its tracks.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Their latest plan is to hold a second referendum.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>They call it a âPeopleâs Voteâ.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But we had the peopleâs vote. The people voted to leave.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A second referendum would be a âpoliticiansâ voteâ: politicians telling people they got it wrong the first time and should try again.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Think for a moment what it would do to faith in our democracy if â having asked the people of this country to take this decision â politicians tried to overturn it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Those of us who do respect the result â whichever side of the question we stood on two years ago â need to come together now.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>If we donât â if we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit â we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And thereâs another reason why we need to come together.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We are entering the toughest phase of the negotiations.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>You saw in Salzburg that I am standing up for Britain.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>What we are proposing is very challenging for the EU.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But if we stick together and hold our nerve I know we can get a deal that delivers for Britain.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And ultimately thatâs what itâs all about.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The people we serve are not interested in debates about the theory of Brexit â their livelihoods depend on making a success of it in practice.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>A Brexit that might make Britain stronger fifty years from now is no good to you if it makes your life harder today.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>If you work in a factory in Pendle, you need a Brexit that keeps trade friction-free and supply-chains flowing.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>If you are a fisherman in Peterhead, you need a Brexit that delivers full control of our waters.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>If you run an exporting business in Penarth, you need a Brexit that will open up new global markets.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>If you live in Pettigo on the Irish border, you need a Brexit that keeps it frictionless and communities connected.</p>\n",

       "<p>English is the global language.</p>\n",

       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>Our scientists and artists want to collaborate with you.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Yet I was the first Prime Minister to visit since Margaret Thatcher.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>There is a whole world out there. Letâs lift our horizons to meet it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The UK has always been an outward-looking trading nation.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And as Conservatives, we believe in the power of a well-regulated free market â the greatest agent of collective human progress ever devised.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We should defend free markets, because it is ordinary working people who benefit.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Closed markets and command economies were not overthrown by powerful elites, but by ordinary people.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>We are giving workers a stronger voice in the boardroom.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>Announced at last yearâs conference, and in place for this winter.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Because we put the interest of consumers first, we have also announced a fundamental review into our railways.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Since privatisation, investment in the network has gone up, safety has improved, and more people are travelling by rail than ever before.</p>\n",

       "<p>But on some routes the service has not been good enough. We will fix that.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And while we do so, we will bring in a new system of auto-compensation, so that when your train is late you wonât have to waste more time getting your money back.</p>\n",

       "<p>Last year I made it my personal mission to fix another broken market: housing.</p>\n",

       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>To put the dream of home ownership back within their reach, we scrapped stamp duty for most first-time buyers â and over 120,000 households have already benefited.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Weâve helped half a million people onto the housing ladder through other schemes like Help to Buy.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And this week we have announced that we will charge a higher rate of stamp duty on those buying homes who do not live and pay taxes in the UK, to help level the playing field for British buyers.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>The money raised will go towards tackling the scourge of rough sleeping.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And at last yearâs conference I announced an additional Â£2 billion for affordable housing.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>But something is still holding many of them back.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>There is a government cap on how much they can borrow against their Housing Revenue Account assets to fund new developments.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Solving the housing crisis is the biggest domestic policy challenge of our generation.</p>\n",

       "<p>It doesnât make sense to stop councils from playing their part in solving it.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>So today I can announce that we are scrapping that cap.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>We will help you get on the housing ladder.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And we will build the homes this country needs.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Our next challenge is to help working people with the cost of living.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",

       "<p>It isnât easy. It never has been.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>And the difference it makes to have a little bit of money left to put away at the end of each month isnât measured in pounds and pence.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Itâs the look on a daughterâs face when her mum says she can have the bike she wants for her birthday.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Itâs the joy and precious memories that a weekâs holiday with the family brings.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Itâs the peace of mind that comes with having some savings.</p>\n",
       "<p>Â </p>\n",
       "<p>Many people, in towns and cities across our country, cannot take these things for granted.</p>\n",

       "<p>Itâs for them that we cut income tax.</p>\n",

       "<p>This is a historic achievement.</p>\n",
