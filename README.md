## GA DSI7 Capstone Project - NLP analysis of UK political speeches

The aim of this project was to build a predictive model that would guess an MP's party based on the text of a speech, without any obvous indicators like party names or party leader names.

I also looked at the vocabularies of speakers from different parties, and carried out topic analysis on the speeches.

My dataset was scraped from the <a href='http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/index.htm'>British Political Speech archive</a>.
